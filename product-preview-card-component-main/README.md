## My process
I started with the desktop version, but then restarted again with mobile. I found it was easier to transition from mobile to desktop, than working in reverse.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I need to focus on becoming more proficient with CSS Grid, but learned a lot with this project.


### Useful resources

- (https://uxplanet.org) - Natasha help me get my grid working properly. I really liked her styling and will use it going forward.
